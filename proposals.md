#### 1. Kickstarter

I grew up observing entrepreneurial character and fortitude from a young age. With its mission to help bring creative projects to life, Kickstarter is a digital platform for arts patronage of sorts. I’m interested to see and predict on what projects succeed and why that could be.

The goal is to understand factors that most significantly contribute to a successful kickstarter project.

#### 2. Travel destination recommender

Soaking in a destination for its culture and customs can be severely limited to how much time the vacationer has to commit to putting together the trip itinerary. Beginning to feel disenchantment and weariness from what it takes to make it to departure day, I’d like to respark an interest in exploration and experience by streamlining the selection of destinations with a content-based recommender.

#### 3. Online Shopper Intentions

Google analytics for a website produces a wealth of information on how visitors interacts with a website. Because this is common data to any e-tailer, I'd like to explore the basics. Curious to know and work with common metrics, I'd like to see how well these metrics can serve as indicators of conversions.
